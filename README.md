# Equivariant graph neural networks for atomic scale simulations (three week project)

This github repository contains some of the core results from tree week project: Equivariant graph neural networks for atomic scale simulations. 

- Initial error considerations.ipynb: this contains a brief data overview of the AuTiO_2 data set, a benchmarking of NequIP models with r_max values as well as different ways of evaluating the error of these models.

- Scripting for evaluating errors.ipynb: shows different ways of illustrating the model error vs the forces of the data-set.

- Presentation On Nequip.pptx: is a PowerPoint on NequIP's network structure.

Initial error considerations.ipynb depends on a previous script to evaluate the models errors: Model_Interpreter.py
Scripting for evaluating errors.ipynb depends on a newer version of this script found at:
